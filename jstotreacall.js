// A. Q + A
// How do we assign a value to a variable? We declare with either; let, const, or var followed by the variable name in camel case and then, the '=' operator

// How do we change the value of a variable? We can reassign a new value to the variable that was previously declared as long as it wasn't a constant.

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable? We declare a new variable and equate it to the existing variable.

// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define? Declare: using either let, const , or var to let js know we are about to declare a variable, assign: given a variable name, define: given a value.

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?writing out what we want the code to achieve to give one a general picture of the task ahead and how it could be executed. It is important because it breaks down the project in an easy to execute manner.

// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it? It depends on the size and complexity of the project.
